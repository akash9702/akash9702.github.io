I am a research scholar at the [MATS Program](https://www.matsprogram.org) working on problems in cooperative AI with Lewis Hammond. In the past, I did a Master's at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk), where I was advised by with Prof. Michael Wooldridge and Dr. Joel Dyer; and a Bachelor's at [IIT Delhi](https://www.iitd.ac.in), where I was advised by Prof. Abhijnan Chakraborty and Prof. Keerti Choudhary.

I'm most motivated by foundational questions in AI that are best approached theoretically, particularly when answering them could meaningfully benefit society but commercial pressures aren't strong enough to solve them. More specifically, I use tools from game theory, social choice, and reinforcement learning to solve problems in multiagent systems and AI alignment. You can read more about my research [here](https://akash9702.github.io/publications/). I'm always happy to chat with those who [drop a line](mailto:akashag9702@gmail.com).
