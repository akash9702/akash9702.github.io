I am a research scholar at the [MATS Program](https://www.matsprogram.org) working on problems in [Cooperative AI](https://www.cooperativeai.org). In the past, I did a Master's at the University of Oxford, where I was advised by with Prof. Michael Wooldridge and Dr. Joel Dyer; and a Bachelor's at IIT Delhi, where I was advised by Prof. Abhijnan Chakraborty and Prof. Keerti Choudhary.

I'm most motivated by foundational questions that are best approached theoretically, particularly when answering them could meaningfully benefit society but commercial pressures aren't strong enough to solve them. You can read more about my research [here](https://akash9702.github.io/publications/). I'm always happy to chat with those who [drop a line](mailto:akashag9702@gmail.com).
